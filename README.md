# Joe Sander's Code Page

 I am an aspiring developer who recently attended Tech Elevator's Fullstack Java Bootcamp. Over the span of four months and 700+ hours of lecture, paired programming projects, exercises, and group projects, I learned how to construct full-stack Java web applications, from developing the server and database to building a web page with front-end frameworks like Vue.js. 
 
 I am currently learning Go along with Linux and AWS/Azure and Docker/Kubernetes with intentions to get a server-side development/administration or a Cloud Developer position.
