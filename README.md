# Hello, welcome to Joe Sander's portfolio page. 

 I am an aspiring junior developer with 10 years experience in sales who recently attended Tech Elevator's Fullstack Java Bootcamp. Over the span of four months and 700+ hours of lecture, paired programming projects, exercises, and group projects, I learned how to build and deploy web applications from building REST APis with Spring Boot on the back end to a front-end built on the Vue.js framework with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I can also develop databases and manage them in PostgreSQL.
