# Joe Sander's Portfolio

 I am an aspiring junior developer who recently attended Tech Elevator's Fullstack Java Bootcamp. Over the span of four months and 700+ hours of lecture, paired programming projects, exercises, and group projects, I learned how to construct full-stack Java web applications, from developing the server and database to building a web page with front-end frameworks like Vue.js.  
 
 ## Languages/Technologies
 * Java
 * JavaScript
 * REST APIs with Spring Boot
 * SQL in PostgreSQL
 * Relational Database Management
 * Vue.js
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * OOP Principles

I am currently learning Go, Linux, AWS and Kubernetes/Docker and my intention is to get a position in server-side administration/development or a Cloud Native position.
