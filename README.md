# Hello, welcome to Joe Sander's portfolio page. 

 I am an aspiring junior developer who recently attended Tech Elevator's Fullstack Java Bootcamp. Over the span of four months and 700+ hours of lecture, paired programming projects, exercises, and group projects, I learned how to build and deploy web applications from building REST APis with Spring Boot on the back end to a front-end built on the Vue.js framework with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I can also develop databases and manage them in PostgreSQL. I am currently learning Go, Linux, AWS and Kubernetes/Docker and my intention is to get a position in server-side administration/development or a Cloud Native position. 
 
 Attached you'll find all my completed projects from the Boot Camp and any I have completed since.
